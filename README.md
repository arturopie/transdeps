# Transdeps

A gem to find inconsistent dependency versions in component-based
Ruby apps.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'transdeps'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install transdeps

## Usage

Add this line to application's Rakefile:

```ruby
require 'transdeps/tasks'
```

Then run:

```bash
bundle exec rake transdeps[/path/to/my/components,/path/to/my/project]
```

Since you are presumably running this task from the root of your project,
you can leave the second argument to the Rake task off, and the
first argument would be a relative path. Something like:

```bash
bundle exec rake transdeps[components]
```
